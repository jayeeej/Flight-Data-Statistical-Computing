# Flight-Data-Statistical-Computing
## Analysing flight data using Python and R, and running the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
Utilized Python and R for statistical computing and implementing the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to perform Monte Carlo simulations. 
Carried out extensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis on flight records, applying logistic regression and visualization techniques to uncover patterns related to delays and flight diversions.
